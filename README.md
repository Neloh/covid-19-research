## The map
It was constructed in Python using a library 'folium' that allows one to build html based maps. 
The html map was deployed as a php application.

We used heroku which uses git based commands. This is done after all the relevant php files have been pushed to the Github repo  
`heroku login`
`heroku create`
`git push heroku master`
